# kolruds_script_browser

A browser for maxscripts, and mcg files.
This is an early release, so guaranteed not bug-free, and still doesn't have much as far as features go.

To run the script, enter this in the listener:
```maxscript
python.executeFile("path\\to\\main.py") -- for double backslash
or
python.executFile(@"path\to\main.py") -- for single backslash
```
